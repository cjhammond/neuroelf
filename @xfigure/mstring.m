function mstr = mstring(hFigure, varargin)
% xfigure::mstring  - manipulate text of a listbox or dropdown
%
% FORMAT:       [subset] = mstring(hControl [,pos [,setstr [,insert]]])
%
% Input fields:
%
%       hControl    xfigure object of type listbox or dropdown
%       pos         numeric array that represents the index of the
%                   requested, replaced, or inserted rows
%       setstr      if given will either replace or insert strings,
%                   for single lines can be a char array, otherwise
%                   a cell array of chars
%       insert      if true inserts strings passed by setstr, otherwise
%                   replace strings
%
% Note: (1) if pos is missing, but setstr is given, setstr will be used to
%           either replace the GUI selected subset or, if insert is true,
%           inserted at the end of the control's string list
%       (2) if pos is given but no setstr is passed, mstring returns
%           the subset of strings indexed by pos
%       (3) without any arguments, mstring returns the GUI selected
%           entries, equivalent to mstring(hControl, hControl.Value)
%       (4) if insert is true, pos gives the lines, where setstr entries
%           are inserted BEFORE, and -Inf and Inf marks the beginning and
%           end of the controls string list
%       (5) whenever a string is inserted, the first inserted entry will
%           be selected after the call is complete
