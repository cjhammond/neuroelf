function [hfile, densm] = srf_Inflate(hfile, niter, force, opts)
% SRF::Inflate  - apply inflation morph
%
% FORMAT:       [srf, densm] = srf.Inflate([niter [, force]])
%
% Input fields:
%
%       niter       number of iterations, default 3000
%       force       smoothing force, default 0.7
%
% Output fields:
%
%       srf         inflated surface
%       densm       density SMP
%
% Note: this method simply passes to SRF::Morph. It automatically set
%       area and distortion correction (to 6 * smoothing)
