% joinlayers  - joining of transimg layers into a HxWx3 image + alpha map
%
% FORMAT:       [j, a] = joinlayers(tio, l)
%
% Input fields:
%
%       tio         1x1 struct of transimg content
%       l           layer spec (numbers)
%
% Output fields:
%
%       j           HxWx3 single image [0.0 .. 255.0]
%       a           HxW single alpha map [0.0 .. 1.0]
