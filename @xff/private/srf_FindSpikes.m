function [spikes, npmin, vdmin, vdmean] = srf_FindSpikes(hfile, cutoff)
% SRF::FindSpikes  - find spiked vertices (1-based indices)
%
% FORMAT:       [spikes, npmin, vdmean] = srf.FindSpikes([cutoff]);
%
% Input fields:
%
%       cutoff      cutoff value for critical sqrt(abs(n*n')),
%                   default: 1/3
%
% Output fields:
%
%       spikes      Vx1 vertex list of found spikes
%       npmin       Vx1 minimal product list per vertex
%       vdmin       Vx1 min vertex-to-neighbors distance
%       vdmean      Vx1 mean vertex-to-neighbors distance
%
% Note: the srf object remains unchanged, often it is more useful
%       to apply e.g. coloring to an unsmoothed mesh
