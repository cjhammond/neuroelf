function [ixx, varargout] = mmregress(x, varargin)
% mmregress  - regress multiple models / multiple data
%
% FORMAT:       [ixx, b, ...] = mmregress(x, y [, ...])
%
% Input fields:
%
%       x           NxR or NxRxM model(s)
%       y, ...      Nx1 or NxM (or Nx1xM) data
%
% Output fields:
%
%       ixx         inverse of the x' * x matrix/ces
%       b, ...      regression beta estimates
%
% Note: please use this function only for a limited set of regressors,
%       as the precision will severely suffer, also if regressors are
%       highly correlated, given the use of the pseudo-inverse function
