function ata = transmul(a, b, flag)
% transmul  - return the multiplication of M' * M or M * M2
%
% FORMAT:       Mt_MT_M = transmul(M [, M2 [, flag]])
%
% Input fields:
%
%       M           double matrix (also works along 3rd dim)
%       M2          double matrix
%       flag        determines whether or not to permute first two dims:
%                   - 0: do not permute either M or M2 (default)
%                   - 1: permute dims 1 and 2 in M but not in M2
%                   - 2: permute dims 1 and 2 in M2 but not in M
%                   - 3: permute dims 1 and 2 in both M and M2
%
% Output fields:
%
%       Mt_MT_M     product of transpose with original
%
% Note: this is a MEX (compiled) function!
